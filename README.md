## Design

### Colour Scheme:
The colour palette was created with the thought of making the website look and feel similar to a book and to provide as much contrast as possible, without feeling overwhelming. Most of the color is primarily provided by the supporting images displayed across the site. However text were generated in black and white, with secondary colors ranging from blue, green and a very small splash of red (f44336).

Main colors:

## Credits

### Content 
My knowledge of html and css is still rather new, So I used some inspiration on one of my previous projects 'Kenzington's Apothecary' I used a similar format for the desktop navbar and some of the colors.

Another useful site that also helped with my forms & a few other little things [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp).

support was provided by my amazing mentor Martina Terlevic and my fianc√©, McKenzie Tyler, with whom I would have struggled a lot more.
